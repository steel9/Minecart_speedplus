Minecart_speed+ v2.0.0

Minecart_speed+ is a Craftbukkit plugin that increases the maximum speed limits of minecarts.

If you want to use the speedometer feature, the plugin ActionBarAPI is required (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbarapi-1-8-1-12-2.1315/). Everything except the speedometer will still work without ActionBarAPI.
