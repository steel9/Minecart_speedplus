Minecart_speed+ v2.0.0

[Download plugin jar]: https://github.com/steel9/Minecart_speedplus/raw/master/bin/Minecart_speedplus_2.0.jar

Minecart_speed+ is a Craftbukkit plugin that increases the maximum speed limits of minecarts.

Minecart_speedplus should be compatible with Spigot 1.12.2

If you want to use the speedometer feature, the plugin ActionBarAPI is required (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbarapi-1-8-1-12-2.1315/). Everything except the speedometer should still work without ActionBarAPI.

New features in steel9 fork:
2.0.0:
- Changes to settings is now saved
- Implemented acceleration and deceleration instead of an instant speed change (when changing speed multiplier with signs)
- Speedometer (experimental, shows set speed, not speed of cart (speed becomes incorrect at higher set speeds than possible)). Requires ActionBarAPI to function (though not required if you don't want a speedometer).
- Project changed to target Java 1.8
- Now building with Spigot API (is probably still compatible with Bukkit)
